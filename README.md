# Significant Linear Hotspot Discovery
## Why Linear Hotspot
Linear Hotspot is a line shape area of significant activity. Our [motivation](https://github.com/SpatialUMN/LinearHotspot-Java/wiki/Motivation-of-Developing-Linear-Hotspot-Detection-Method) of developing linear hotspot detection method is to identify accident prone road segment

## Case Study

## Future Attribution
Linear hotspot discovery can also be applied to other application domains. Certain types of crimes (e.g., assaults, street robbery) may form hotspots on transportation networks that represent roads needing more attention from police departments [4]. In addition, water quality changes on river networks may form hotspots that represent bursts of pollution [6].
